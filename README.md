## Introduction

Meteorite landings have been recorded globally, and this React app aims to offer users an engaging way to explore and understand these occurrences. By visualizing the data on an interactive map, users can gain insights into the distribution and details of meteorite landings.

## Features

- **Interactive Map Visualization**: The app provides an interactive map using libraries like React-Leaflet to display meteorite landing locations worldwide. Each marker on the map represents a meteorite landing site.

- **Filtering and Sorting**: Users can filter and sort meteorite data based on attributes such as mass, year, and classification. This helps users narrow down their exploration.

- **Hover Information**: Hovering over a meteorite marker on the map displays essential information about the meteorite, such as its name, classification, and year of landing.
